REST is a popular term out there on the internet. I wanted to de-mystify it for those who were intimidate it. Covered what REST was.
Basics of HTTP. Tools. And of course, where to go next.

Side Note: This is about the time I started to realize that picking gifs in a theme was more fun. This one was entirely simpsons based.
