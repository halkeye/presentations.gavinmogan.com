          <p>Okay.. Time for me to ask you a question.</p>
          <p>Hands up if you develop on a daily basis?</p>

        <p>(Gavin draws the best)</p>
        <aside class="notes">
          <p>So moving into a bit more formalized topic...</p>

          <p>Here we have the testing pyramid.
            You can find many variations of the same thing but this one I lovingly created.</p>

          <p>The idea is that you spend most of your time writing unit tests. They are discrete chunks of tests that
            confirm small pieces of code.</p>

          <p>Next up you have integration tests. Those typically will reach out to other systems. They are slower. Take
            more time to setup.</p>

          <p>Lastly you have the complete end to end tests. They are the slowest to run, so you don't want to do them
            all the time.
            Sauce Labs actually specializes in this layer when you are doing web testing.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          <p>So why should you write tests?</p>

          <p>When I was a developer at telus, I was quickly put on a legacy project and was told to get up to speed.</p>

          <p>I was lucky enough to convince them to spend a couple weeks writing tests.</p>

          <p>By the time I was finished, not only did I know all the models and db schema inside and out, but I actually
            found a few bugs and dead code.</p>

        <h3> "We need time to test" </h3>
        <ul style="width: 100%">
          <li>Often leads to features being shipped that have never been used</li>
          <li>Blame others (QA) when things don't get caught</li>

        <p></p>
        <h3> Why not testing first? </h3>
        <ul style="width: 100%">
          <li>Helps you think about design</li>
          <li>Lets you fail fast</li>
          <li>Write failing test first, then code</li>
          <li>Refactoring later isn't scary</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          <p>This is actually one of my biggest pet peeves. If you haven't written any tests, its really not done yet.
            So time shouldn't be a factor. But I do understand time crunches and project managers.</p>

          <p>I'm by no means perfect, I leave a bunch of testing till late in my development. But my development these
            days tends to span a day or two, so testing is still really early considering.</p>

          <p>There are some ways to convince people though. There are tons of studies on how writing tests actually
            increases development speed. I feel like it has a lot to do with peace of mind. Don't need to be afraid of
            trying something because you have a safety net of tests.</p>
          <p>---

          <p>Failing fast means you can try something without working on all the boiler plate around it.</p>

          <p>Add function takes two numbers, 1 and 2, does it equal 3? Cool works, does it throw an exception? boo</p>

          <p>Failing tests help prevent false positives. Testing javascript callbacks especially lead to this.</p>

          <p>How do I run tests? </p>

          <p>The list of tooling and frameworks is ever growing bigger. I can't stress enough there's no right way of
            testing, just the way that works the perfect or best for you.</p>

          <p>Generally there are two categories. Often frameworks will fall into both but not always.</p>

          <p>Grunt, gulp, and guard all specialize in running tasks, so they are great at re-running the entire test
            suite when files are changed. I personally have mine setup to beep at me when things fail so I don't have to
            keep an eye on it.</p>

          <p>Mocha, qunit, rspec, and others are more the testing frameworks. They are how you write the tests. How you
            see the results, etc.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          <p>Lots of people run automated tests. Sometimes referred to as continuous integration.</p>

          <p>My personal favourite two are travis ci and jenkins.</p>

          <p>Travis-ci is great for open source projects. Its 100% free, and you can do whatever you want.</p>

          <p>Jenkins is better for when you have a large collection of projects.</p>

          <p>Sauce labs, as well as myself for my own person projects, use a mixture of both</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          <p>As I said earlier. Start by taking a script or segment you'd normally try out on its own, and make it into
            its own full test.</p>

          <p>On my team at sauce, for our rest apis. If its in a test, we are allow to use it in other components. It's
            considered a guaranteed return value. </p>

          <p>I originally started with bugs. If I had a bug report, I'd make a test for it so I could prove how it
            happened, and help prevent it from happening again in the future.</p>

          <p>In my opinion, Its very tempting to setup a complete environment, fake users, fake posts, fake everything.
            But the bigger the more complicated the test the harder it will to maintain. </p>

          <p>Big tests are really good, but they can come later.</p>

          <p>That doesn't mean no bugs occur, but its a start.</p>

          <p>At the start, there's really no wrong way of testing. When you start to have a lot of tests, then it makes
            sense to worry about how long they take, and combining if necessary.</p>
