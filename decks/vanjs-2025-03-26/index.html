          Hey everyone,
          I'm Gavin. I am a Senior Software Developer at digitalocean. I've been doing this a long long time in tech terms. More than 5 whole years.

          Today I'm planning on covering the basics of the command line and linux, so it becomes a lot less intimidating. Don't worry if you know everything about linux already, as I guarentee with no money back, that you will still learn one thing new. I know this because when I looked at my past presentations, I learned new things.

          I also want to be up front that I have a referral code  for digitalocean that i'll show at the end for people can use if they want to play around with anything without risking thier own computer. Nothing i'm covering is dangerous, but i like giving people oppertunties. If you already have an account, the code won't work, so come talk to rodrigo or myself who can help figure something out.

          I'm one of those weird backend developers that uses windows full time, and its been years since I used a mac, but from what I read online, most people are pretty comfortable with the built in Terminal app. When I was a mac user, iterm2 was the goto app.

          --

          I have a slide in a bit that covers ones that work on all oses.

          So before I get started while I think everything I'm going to cover today will be safe, I understand how scary this can be, so if you want to test it out in a risk free environment, you are welcome to use my digital ocean referral code to get yourself credits. This only applies to new accounts, but we got approval for people with existing accounts, so you can come chat with rodrigo or myself and we can get you some credits to try things out.
