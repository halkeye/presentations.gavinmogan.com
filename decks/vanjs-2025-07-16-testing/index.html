          One surprising thing i've learned about testing, especially in open source projects where documentation can be
          lacking, is to see the actual usages of a library or application in action. I can see what data they are
          expecting, and how its handled. Does a lot of the expiramentation for me.

          One of the talks last last month talks about how AI coding assistant tools can actually use tests to make sure
          new code suggestion actually doesn't break old behaviors. I believe it can also help with code style based on
          the topics mentioned in previous slide.

          I'll talk about it more later, but I just love creating tests for bug tickets I'm assigned. It helps me
          understand the problem then I can guarantee long into the future that the specific behavior won't happen

          First up we have end to end tests. The goal is to emulate user behavior and confirm everything works together.
          This means as much real life stuff as possible. Real browsers, real apis calls, and talking to the backend
          properly.
          While its not always possible to automate a production environment, especially since there's often tooling to
          prevent bots and other abuse, you can get pretty close. Maybe add your ips to a allowlist so it doesn't get
          caught by security. Its a slippery slope though since you can easily hide actual issues and not catch them.

          E2e Strengths... the goal is to test the whole system. So make sure everything works together. Api responses.
          UI
          responses. For example, if suddenly your login apis start requiring two factor auth, but you haven't enabled
          it on the front end, the tests will fail. It can also highlight differences between browsers, and there are
          tools to help you confirm behavior with limited network connections etc.

        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          Weaknesses. Since you are doing everything with real behaviors, it can be tricker to create or reset states.
          You can't just change runtime variables like having a user with an existing shopping cart from a previous
          session. With e2e tests you'll have to either have a user kept around that has that state permanently, or go
          through all the steps to populate a shopping cart, but that wont let you test a legacy format.

          Also, there's so much stuff out of your control. If an error message from the backend slightly changes, that
          can cause your tests to fail, and depending on what framework you use, you might not be able to tell why the
          test is failing, just that it cant find the string you want.

          Tooling. I'm far from an expert here as I'm no longer doing frontend development full time but i've included a
          few I've heard about.
          Selenium is one of the oldest browser automation tools out there. You can find so much guides and tips for it,
          but at the same time, it breaks the easiest. Playwright and Cypress are much newer and more reliable, and at
          least to some degree, have backing of browser developers. Lastly there's testcafe. From my research it uses
          client side javascript to trigger browser behavior, as such it can let you test on anything from modern
          browsers, phones, to even smart tvs.

          I'm also mentioning appium because some of friends created and maintain it. It lets you automate a phone, so
          install apps, click on things, etc. Its really quite powerful.

        <h2>Mocked E2E Tests</h2>
        <p>A hybrid model between full e2e and isolated testing.</p>
        <p>Call mocks or fake endpoints to emulate.</p>
        <p>Bigger units of work, but also more control.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Login Form</li>
          <li>REST server endpoint</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          Okay, Mocked E2e tests, or integration tests, that tends to be what I write more of now, even though I
          probably shouldn't. I'll use a real database, but i might mock out external systems like stripe. Especially if
          I know said system is pretty stable.
        </aside>

      <section>
        <h2>Mocked - Strengths</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Can control states</li>
          <li>Easy to spot new dependencies</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          Strengths...
          <p>With using mocks and stubs and factories and all the other terms, you have a lot more control. For example,
            instead of setting up a new user, marking them as abuse, and then trying to login. With mocks you can just
            tell the user service to return a user in the right state.</p>
          <p>And with most mocking libraries, they can yell at you when your code starts to connect to unmocked systems
            or endpoints</p>
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Mocked - Cons</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Have to implement and maintain mocks or sample data</li>
          <li>Can lead to complex mocks that dont actually test things</li>
          <li>Can easily break if your code uses globals</li>
          <li>Can hide external systems changing</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          Cons.. Anyone who has done tests for a while will tell you how dangerous mocks can be. If your mocks just
          return simple states, like static json files, its pretty safe, but it becomes so easy for your mocks to become
          more dynamic. Return different states based on inputs. Soon your tests will start testing your mocks instead
          of testing the systems the mocks use.
          In non typed systems, it can also not be obvious when the system you are mocking has changed. This can mean
          something small like you are assuming an whole number integer, when the api now returns a float or string.
          Injecting mocks can be hard too, there are tools to make it easier, but if for example your function makes an
          http call, and you use a global http library, it'll be hard to isolate the client enough that it doesn't leak
          to other tests, or a test could be run in parallel.

          <p>Nock has always been an under utilalized tool. I don't know if it will work in browsers, but its great in
            express and nodejs. You can just target specific http requests and mock out responses. It can yell if the
            targets arn't found so can highlight when your systems start making calls you forgot about.</p>
          <p>Jest is a pretty big industry standard these days. I'll talk about it more when I talk about testing
            frameworks, but it can also provide mocks. </p>
          <p>Sinon has been around forever, and for good reasons. Its mocks are straight forward and reliable</p>
          <p>Mock service worker is one I just learned about, it sounds like its nock, but for browsers. It gives you
            the ability to intercept http calls and inject responses.</p>

        <h2>"Regular"/"Unit" tests</h2>
        <p>Focus on small units of work.</p>
        <p>Make them fast, and have a ton of them</p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          Okay, last item from my pyramid is what I'm calling unit tests. Ideally you only ever test a single function
          or single unit of work, but but with react that can get a bit complicated. The main thing is they shouldn't be
          testing anything it doesn't own. So no database, rest, graphql or anything else.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Unit Tests - Strengths</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Fast</li>
          <li>Just focus on input and output</li>
          <li>Easy to write</li>
          <li>Easy to maintain</li>
          <li>Can be run in parallel (unless you use globals 😭)</li>
          <li>Indirectly can lead to maintainable and understandable code</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          Since unit tests are not interfacing with any other systems, they are usually the most fast. You pass in some
          inputs, and you check the outputs, you don't need to wait.

          Because of this, the more practice you get with them, the more you want your functions to work in that way. So
          for normal functions you can probably figure out how that works, just have parameters. But for things like a
          react component, that means you want to have attributes not hooks. Have the hooks outside the component at the
          integration level.

          Then quickly you start writing functions and units that are small and do like one thing. It takes a while, and
          I'll def go over how to do that later, but it does help.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Unit Tests - Cons</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Doesnt break when external systems change</li>
          <li>Devevelopment before testing often involves coming back and redoing development to make it testable</li>
          <li>Globals can make it hard to isolate</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          The main downside is because you are testing inputs and outputs, there's no indication when external systems
          change the inputs. In truth it shouldn't matter because you should have other tests that test those things,
          but it is a gap here.

          Also globals can make things really hard to test. If you use like a window dot location, or a process dot env,
          since they are not passed in as inputs, you can't really control them or parallelize without issues.

          Both are probably good reasons to refactor though.

        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <aside class="notes">So I got started with testing long before I knew what formal testing was. My first job was
          working directly on clients servers, live, with no backups. It was awful. So i got in the habit of isolating
          what I was working on so I could run a simplified version on my own computer first. </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Getting started pt2</h2>
        <p>You don't need a formal framework</p>
        <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
            const Users = require('./models/users.js');

            Users.createUser({
            &nbsp;&nbsp;username => "zoidberg",
            &nbsp;&nbsp;password => "doctor"
            }).then(function(user) {
            &nbsp;&nbsp;console.log($user);
            });
          </code></pre>
        <aside class="notes">Its totally fine, especially for your own projects, just to do things like this. Create a
          file that imports your functionality and runs that. The only difference between that and a official test is
          the frameworks to get it running.
          So start there. Get in the habit. See the benefits.

      <section>
        <h2>Getting started pt3</h2>
        <p><s>Testing every scenario</s></p>
        <aside class="notes">
          I think the biggest pitfall to get testing started is that people try to do everything at once. Its okay that
          your test only checks the "everything was done right" path.
          There's nothing wrong with that. Testing is an investment in the future. You can and should add more over
          time, but one test is so much better than no tests.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Start with bugs</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Already include reproduction steps</li>
          <li>Already need to have a way to say its done</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          So my suggestion, if you arn't going to do tests with development, is to setup tests when you get bug reports,
          sure start with the simple ones, but start there.
          A good bug report will have repoduction steps, so you can design the scenario, and by reproducing the bug,
          you understand the bug. Ideally you start with your test failing in that scenario.
          Then you fix the problem. Now your test should show the problem is fixed.

          Yay! you just did test driven development (sorta).

          But all you are saying is this very exact scenario won't happen again. You don't need to do more than that.
          It'll come over time

      <section>
        <h2>Install tooling</h2>
        <pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="language-bash">
            $ npm install --save-dev jest
          </code></pre>
        <aside class="notes">
          So i'm going to be using jest for my examples. Its the tooling i've most recently used in the javascript
          space, and most other tools will be more or less the same. I will say its from acebook and i've found its
          really the easiest to get started.

          So first step is install jest into your project.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>sum.test.js</h3>
        <pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="language-javascript">
            const sum = (a, b) => a+b;

            test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
            &nbsp;&nbsp;expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
            })
          </code></pre>
        <pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="language-bash">
            $ jest sum.test.js
          </code></pre>
        <aside class="notes">
          Second is to create a test function, run your function, and check the output.
          Lots of unit testing frameworks try and make things readable as english. In this case, you are describing the
          test, then running the function, and confirming the return value is what is expected.

        <h3>Success!</h3>

        </figure>
        <aside class="notes">
          Lastly run the test. With jest it should just be jest and then your filename or directory. Most other
          frameworks work the same way.

        <h2>Tools I didn't know where to put</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Chromatic - Visual regression testing (SaaS but i've seen open source versions)</li>
          <li>Storybook - Component library</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          So storybook and chromatic are tools that overlap with eachother, but at the same time can be used
          independently.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Storybook - Component library</h3>
        <img src="./storybook.webp" alt="Storybook screenshot showing a component library" />
        <aside class="notes">
          Storybook is a component library which means it can list out all your components, and show them in different
          states. If that sounds like testing, it honestly overlaps a lot. There's actually plugins to run tests right
          inside storybook. I've also seen plugins for letting you toggle your browsers prefer dark or light mode. Or
          give you accessibility reports.


          I really liked having tooling so you can change all the input values and see what the state looks like. When I
          used it for jenkins, I embedded all the tests in there so you could step through the states the tests ran
          through. It was really cool, and its like 5 versions since I used it, so I can only assume its mind blowing
          now.

      <section>
        <h3>Chromatic - Visual regression testing</h3>
        <img src="./chromatic.webp" alt="Chromatic screenshot showing a visual regression test" />
        <aside class="notes">
          Chromatic is a tool by the same company, or at least was the same company. It can let you compare screenshots
          of your components to previous versions, and highlight changes.

          Infact from what I learned researching this talk, storybook can do most things chromatic can, but chromatic
          adds like workflow approvals, multiple devices, and other automation that is much harder for your own hosted
          tools. (hashtag not sponsored)

What is testing?
---
What kinds of tests? - In my opinion there are only two types that matter, integration and non integration tests. Most people will call non integration tests unit tests, but thats not totally accurate.

Integration tests are tests that test the system as a whole, or at least a large part of it. They are often slower, but they give you confidence that the system works as a whole.
Unit tests test a small unit of work. From a purist point of view, a unit test can't call other functions, just its own small set of work.

in reality, the term in way more broad. I would say its anything that isn't an integration test is a unit test, and try to avoid mocking as much as possible for unit tests.

So I would say there's three. E2E integration tests, mocked integration tests, and unit tests.

So what are unit tests?
<next slide>

----

How do I get started?

I would say focus on isolating before worying about anything formal. In react this might mean make a new route that just has your component on it with hardcoded values. This allows you to create a scenario without worrying about how to get there.
If you are doing a rest interface. You can do the same with a new route.
The premise is still the same for scripts or libraries or anything else.

That gets you in the habit of thinking about creating smaller units of work.

For example, lets say you have a login form in react. It has two input fields and one button. Sounds small and simple right? But in reality it gets hard to setup an example
You need to make sure the username gets filled out, then make sure the password gets filled out, then click on the button, oh wait you need to check if the password field has stars instead of text, okay click the button, wait now the form submitted, did it work?
That gets really complicated really fast.

Instead lets break it down.
Start with just the username component. Set the value using the value attribute. Refresh. Does the value show up? You have a test case
:fireworks:

Cool we are done right? Its time to go home?

Well..... kinda. I still do this kind of thing a lot, especially when i'm thinking to myself or rubber ducking. Just want to see what if.
------- Show react testing utils to render then fill out value, then check render
--- Talk about mocks in general
--- talk about e2e tests


--- Move comments about react vs rest vs cli etc earlier on, and say "Gonna use react as my examples as I would expect the majority of people here have heard of it if not touched it.
If you check out the deck on my website, I'm going to try and have some examples or references but not really cover them.
